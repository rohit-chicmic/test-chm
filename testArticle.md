Filling Gaps in Original Medicare Coverage

As a retiree or senior nearing retirement age, you may be considering your healthcare options. One important aspect to understand is how Original Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for
people 65+, works and what gaps it might leave in your coverage. In this article, we will explore these gaps and discuss how Medicare Supplement Insurance can help fill them.

**What is Original Medicare?**

Original Medicare is a federal program that provides basic healthcare coverage to eligible individuals 65+. It's administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and offers two main types
of coverage: Part A, which covers inpatient care, such as hospital stays, and Part B, which covers outpatient services, including doctor visits.

**What are the gaps in Original Medicare?**

While Original Medicare provides a solid foundation for healthcare coverage, it has some limitations. These gaps can leave you with significant out-of-pocket expenses:

* **Deductible**: You'll need to pay $1,472 per year (2022) before Original Medicare starts covering your medical expenses.
* **20% coinsurance**: For many services, including doctor visits and hospital stays, you'll be responsible for 20% of the total cost. This can add up quickly.
* **No out-of-network coverage**: Original Medicare only covers care received from healthcare providers within its network. If you need to see a specialist or receive treatment outside your network, you
may face significant costs.

**What is Medicare Supplement Insurance?**

Medicare Supplement Insurance, also known as Medigap, helps fill these gaps in Original Medicare coverage by providing additional benefits and coverage. Medigap policies are offered by private insurance
companies and can help pay for:

* Deductibles
* Coinsurance
* Out-of-network care
* Additional services not covered by Original Medicare

**Choosing the Best Medicare Gap Insurance**

When selecting a Medigap policy, consider the following factors:

* **Plan types**: There are 10 standard plan types (A through N), each with varying levels of coverage and premiums.
* **Premium costs**: Premiums vary depending on your age, health status, and location. Shop around to find the best rates.
* **Network limitations**: Some Medigap policies may have network restrictions or require you to use specific healthcare providers.

**How Does Medicare Supplement Insurance Work?**

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Enroll in Original Medicare**: First, sign up for Original Medicare (Part A and Part B).
2. **Choose a Medigap policy**: Select a Medigap policy from a private insurance company.
3. **Pay premiums**: Pay your monthly or annual premium to the insurance company.
4. **File claims**: When receiving medical services, file claims with both Original Medicare and your Medigap provider.

**Medicare Supplement Insurance for Seniors**

As you approach retirement age, it's essential to understand how Medicare Supplement Insurance can help fill gaps in Original Medicare coverage. By choosing the right policy, you can enjoy more
comprehensive healthcare coverage and peace of mind.
